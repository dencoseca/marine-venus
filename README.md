# Marine Venus

Marine Venus is a charter yacht based in the Caribbean. The site is intended to be a landing page / profile for potential holiday goers. They are then redirected, at multiple points, to the charter company that hires out the yacht. This website is ultimately intended to direct the viewer away from itself and towards booking facilities. A single page layout was the most appropriate way to achieve this.

## Status

Complete.

## Reflection

This was my first time using a CSS framework and SASS as the project was very early on in teaching myself to code. Iâ€™d previously completed a few Bootstrap courses on YouTube and Udemy so seeing how I could use the structure and utility of Bootstrap with my own styling was an eye opener.

Learning jQuery to animate DOM elements was really exciting. After learning how to interact directly with the DOM using JavaScript the possibilities seemed endless and I immediately started seeking out animation libraries to learn more about manipulating the DOM after this project.
